# Raspberry Pi Radio Logger
This is a little radio logger I built to run on a Raspberry Pi to record the shows that I broadcast.

It's based around streamripper and pulls the Icecast stream and outputs the file with a timestamp into my FTP folder retrieval.

I scheduled it to run whenever I'm on air via crontab and it just sort of works.

It's not pretty, but it gets the job done.
